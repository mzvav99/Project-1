# Project-1
SQL Restaurant Inspection Results Analysis conducted for my INFO521 course at Emory University

The goal of the project was to come up with 5 research questions to answer using a dataset of your choosing. The dataset I chose to use was the NYC Restaurant Inspection Results from the NYC Health website. The project allowed for the use of other coding languages for clean-up, as long as answering the research questions was done in SQL. I chose to use R Studio for clean-up as seen in the R file of the GitHub project.
