# Project-1
SQL Restaurant Inspection Results Analysis conducted for my INFO521 course at Emory University

The goal of the project was to come up with 5 research questions to answer using a dataset of your choosing. The dataset I chose to use was the NYC Restaurant Inspection Results from the NYC Health website. The project allowed for the use of other coding languages for clean-up, as long as answering the research questions was done in SQL. I chose to use R Studio for clean-up as seen in the R file of the GitHub project. 

The code demonstrates various skills and techniques for working with relational databases including data retrieval, filtering, and aggregation. It involves using SELECT statements with JOIN and GROUP BY clauses to retrieve data from multiple tables. The code showcases filtering data using WHERE clauses, ordering results with ORDER BY, and limiting results with the LIMIT clause. Subqueries (derived tables) are used to calculate averages, and the code employs aggregate functions like COUNT and AVG for data aggregation. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of CASE WHEN statements to categorize and count specific data points.
